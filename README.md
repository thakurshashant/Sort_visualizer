# Searching and Sorting Algorithms Visualizer
=====================================================

This project is an interactive visualization tool for various searching and sorting algorithms, allowing users to understand and compare the performance of different algorithms.

## Features

* Implemented algorithms:
	+ Searching algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search, Prism Search
	+ Sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Prism Sort
* Interactive visualization of algorithm steps
* Performance metrics (e.g., time complexity, space complexity)
* User input for custom data sets
* Comparison of algorithm performance
